# API DOC

This API allows users to submit receipts and retrieve the number of points awarded based on pre-defined rules. The data is processed in memory, meaning that it will not persist after the application is restarted.

Endpoints

## Get Points
- Path: v0/receipts/{id}/points
- Method: GET
- Response: JSON object containing the number of points awarded for the receipt.

Description:

Example Response:
```json
{
  "points": 32
}
```


## Notes
- Data is stored in memory and will not persist across application restarts.
- A unique id is generated for each receipt upon submission, and this id is used to retrieve points information.
